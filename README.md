After training the model, it's important to evaluate its performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. This can be done by splitting the dataset into training and testing sets or using cross-validation.

This is a basic implementation. The performance can be improved by experimenting with different preprocessing steps, feature extraction techniques, and machine learning models. Additionally, consider using more advanced techniques like word embeddings or deep learning models for better accuracy.
